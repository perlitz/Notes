# Variational autoencoder - a dual perspective view

**Variational Autoencoder** ([Kingma & Welling, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)) is generative algorithm inheriting the *Variational* part of its name from the method of *Variational base* (**CITE**) and its *Autoencoder* part of its name from the general Autoencoder architecture. Concurring with its naming, motivation to VAE method can be applied from these two perspectives., either as an **Autoencoder turned generative** or an **Generative model framed as an Autoencoder**
