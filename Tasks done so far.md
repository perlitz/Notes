# What I did so far 

1. Generalized sections of the PD pipeline to Vehicle detection. Including generating and training an extra branch of semantic segmentation network to output vehicle blubs. 
2. Created a DB-independent mechanism for ground truth handling in PD pipeline.
3. Performed an deep comparison regarding the mechanisms of SIRC and Checkerboards algorithms for pedestrian detection.
